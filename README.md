# Traffic Accident Severity Shiny App
 This was a university project where we were tasked with creating a Shiny app in R that uses a logistic regression to investigate what variables impact the chance of having a severe traffic accident, given an accident occurred.
 
In particular, the aim of the project was to see how changing the speed limit of the road impacts the chance of severe accident, however, confoudners were added into the regression as to see how speed limit directly impacts the risk of severe accident. 

The goal was to assign a risk of severe accident score after choosing properties of the road. For example, perhaps the user would like to know the chance of a severe accident given the speed limit was 50mph and the road is wet.

Building the app introduced my to the dashboard functions (basically, generating a nicer looking shiny app) of R shiny which was not taught as part of the university course (and hopefully good grades will ensue ;) ).

The app is <a href="https://rypoll.shinyapps.io/Traffic_Accident_LogisticModel/">here</a>.
